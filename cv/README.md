Journalist turned programmer. Promoter of women in tech. Wanderer of the world and learner of a great many things.

Full stack developer. Advocate for OpenData; its use and communication. I believe OpenData is as powerful as freedom of speech. Paired with inclusivity and a free and open web, I believe in its potential as a powerful conduit for knowledge-share.
