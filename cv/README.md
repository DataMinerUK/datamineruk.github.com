## Nicola Hughes

Journalist turned programmer. Promoter of women in tech. Wanderer of the world and learner of a great many things.

Advocate for OpenData; its use and communication. I believe OpenData is as powerful as freedom of speech. Paired with inclusivity and a free and open web, I believe in its potential as a powerful conduit for knowledge-share.

Left CNN International to learn to code with tech startup ScraperWiki, becoming a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow at the Guardian in 2012 and a data journalist at the Times & Sunday Times the following year. Spent three intensive moths at Makers Academy learning web development skills.
