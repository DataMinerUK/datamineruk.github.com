        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p><b>Knowing when a field of expertise should be disrupted by technology and being self-motivated to pick up the skills to do so. </b>
          I taught myself to scrape websites and parse data using Python.
          This ability enabled me to develop a data driven investigative approach at the Digital Team of the Times of London.
          I was able to show to journalists and editors the importance of open data.
          I also used my technical knowledge to advise on how to move the team forward to develop data driven stories.</p>
        <p><b>Knowing when good practice is needed before gaining more skills and seeking out those who can show me. </b>
          I developed a test-driven-development and object-oriented-approach to software craftsmanship during my time at Makers Academy.
          Through pair programming I learned good, clean and scalable code practice.
          Team-based project work honed my version control skills.
          Mostly, I learned how to approach a coding problem, how to explore new technologies and how to learn them better.</p>
        <p><b>Knowing how to solve problems. </b>
         I am not just good at solving problems. I am good at communicating them. Not just verbally. I build. I take apart constructs.
         I reconstruct what I have learned. And I communicate it to the outside world. To those with little or no technical knowledge of what I found or how I found it.
         I do not just code. I engineer. I do not just enginner. I reengineer.</p>
        <p>I do not do things by halves. What you are looking at was meant to be a README...</p>
