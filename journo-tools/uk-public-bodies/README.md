UK Public Bodies
================

This is a table built from information freely provided by [WhatDoTheyKnow][WDTK], who are run by [MySociety][MyS]. It uses the JQuery plugin [DataTables][DT]. This builds a DataTable with information, homepage and FOI link for all the UK public bodies listed on [WhatDoTheyKnow][WDTK]. There is also a drop down menu to filter by the tags used on [WhatDoTheyKnow][WDTK].
