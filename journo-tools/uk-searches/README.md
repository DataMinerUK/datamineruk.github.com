UK Searches
===========

This is a collection of Google Custom Searches for sets of public bodies in the UK. The site URLS and tags are taken from data freely provided by [WhatDoTheyKnow][WDTK], who are run by [MySociety][MyS]. To search all UK public body sites just enter your search term in the Google search bar. To search specific sites, e.g. all NHS sites, select NHS from the drop-down menu and enter your search term in the Google search bar. To see which UK public bodies are included in the custom search select the tag from the drop-down menu in my [UK Public Bodies][UKPB] datatable.
