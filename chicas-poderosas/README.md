Chicas Poderosas
================

[Chicas Poderosas](http://chicaspoderosas.org/) is a Latin American movement to bring more women into technology in newsrooms to:

* Connect: By building local and regional communities of women working in technology 
and news
* Inspire: Through meetups and workshop events, the Chicas Poderosas movement will put a spotlight on women who are leaders in IT, software development and interactive strategies in media
* Empower: Chicas Poderosas-sponsored hackathons, scrapathons and bootcamps focusing on data and data-visualization will create a space for women to share knowledge and skills. These meetups will offer opportunities for networking and launching joint projects that help build Chicas Poderosas communities across Latin American countries.

Costa Rica
----------

For the event in Costa Rica I used [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com) to scrape the Costa Rican entries in [Avibase](http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org), the world bird database. See the code for the scraper in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/DataMinerUK/5907695). I then selected the threatened, vulnerable and endangered species and scraped audio files for them from [xeno-canto](http://xeno-canto.org). See the code for the scraper in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/DataMinerUK/5907755). Audio files are under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

I then built [this](http://datamineruk.github.io/chicas-poderosas/costa-rica/) webpage for which you can find the code in the Costa Rica folder.
